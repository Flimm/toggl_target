Toggl Target
============

At work, we track our working hours on Toggl (www.toggl.com), so I created this small project to calculate how many hours I should work to achieve my monthly goals.

You will need to install `requests` and `dateutil` python libraries to be able to use this.

To get started, rename `config.py-example` to `config.py` and edit the values in it. 

Your Toggl  API token can be found in your account's settings.
